## Go to [https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js).

## To correct nonsensical slanderous stories and wild speculation, I have published text on [Medium](https://medium.com/@alexhultman/beware-of-tin-foil-hattery-f738b620468c). Please have a read.
