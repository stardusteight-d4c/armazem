# Armazem | Fully Functional Social Network

![banner](banner.png)

> A totally `authorial project` developed around a month and a half, its objective is to connect manga readers in which users can authenticate
> on the platform send connection requests to each other, as well as post, like, share and discuss about certain subjects, they can also mark the
> manga they are reading, intend to read or that they have already completed, favorite and update. There are `private routes` only available to 
> `administrators who can insert new manga into the database`. There is chat and discussions with `two-way communication between client and server` 
> via `websockets`. All this being supported by a `RESTful API` on the backend, and with `dynamic rendering of React components` on the frontend.
